# Tiny TFTP

_Tiny TFTP_ is a project for the Computer Networks course of _Ingegneria Informatica_ (Computer Engineering Bachelor's Degree) in University of Pisa. It consists of an implementation of RFC 1350.

## Warning
Since it consists of an exercise for the students like me, it is not required that it is completely implemented, so probably I might not fully implement RFC 1350! Do not use this, or if you do, check what has been implemented and what has not!
